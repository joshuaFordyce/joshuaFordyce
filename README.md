# Applied AI MLOps | Distributed Data Systems | Reducing Developer Friction
Hi I'm Joshua. I architect and build the "glue code" that connections cutting edge llm and RAG tools with high-scale data infrastucture. My core focus is reducing developer friction by creating robust, observable, and performant extensions for modern MLOps frameworks

My passion for simplifying complex infrastructure began at Oracle and ramped up at Starburst, where I specialized in high performance Trino data access over massive data lakes.

# Starburst Contributions:
  - My work centers on develoepr and operator efficiency.
    - Contributions to Minitrino (lightweight testing envirionments)
    - Comprehensive Trino Runbooks for advanced debugging
    - The Terraform toolkit for declarative data infrastucture deployment
   
# Expertise:
  - This experiences has made me an expert in deploying, optimizing and troubleshooting complex Distributed Systems and Kubernetes/Container     infrastucture for petabyte-scale data access

# Open Source Contributions
  - Semantrino
    - Provides a tested, production-ready bluperint for high-accuracy RAG on SQL data
  - Truss VLM
  - Truss VLLM
    - Adds crucial monitoring/governance to VLLMS
  - VectorHub
    - Provides a vector store agnostic federalized client for retrieving vectorized data from multiple Vector Stores at once
  - LLamaIndex Trino Reader
    - Improves efficiency and integration for data loading into vector/indexing tools
